# Project-on-Mushroom-Classification
Abstract:
This project focuses on the classification of mushrooms into edible and poisonous categories based on a set of 22 categorical features. The goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately determines the edibility of mushrooms using the provided dataset. The project involves feature selection through chi-square tests to identify the most significant features and the utilization of machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, to build the classification model. The project aims to provide a reliable tool for distinguishing between edible and poisonous mushrooms.

Introduction:
The Mushroom Classification project revolves around the analysis and prediction of mushroom edibility. Mushrooms are widely consumed and have various species, some of which can be highly toxic. Therefore, accurately determining the edibility of mushrooms is crucial for both culinary and safety purposes. This project aims to develop a robust prediction model that can effectively identify whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its categorical features.

Dataset Description:
The dataset used for this project contains 22 categorical features that describe various characteristics of mushrooms, including cap shape, cap surface, cap color, bruises, odor, gill attachment, gill spacing, gill size, gill color, stalk shape, stalk root, stalk surface above and below the ring, stalk color above and below the ring, veil type and color, ring number and type, spore print color, population, and class. Each feature provides specific information about the mushroom's physical attributes.

Methodology:

Exploratory Data Analysis: The dataset is analyzed to understand the distribution and patterns of the categorical features. Descriptive statistics and visualizations are used to gain insights into the data.

Feature Selection: Chi-square tests are conducted to determine the significance of each feature in relation to mushroom edibility. Features with high chi-square scores or low p-values are considered more influential in predicting the target variable.

Model Building: Machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, are employed to build a classification model. The selected significant features are used as input variables, and the target variable is the edibility of mushrooms. The model is trained using the training dataset and evaluated for its performance.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using appropriate performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the area under the ROC curve. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous.

Results and Conclusion:
The project aims to identify the most important features for predicting mushroom edibility and develop an accurate classification model. The results will showcase the significance of each feature and the model's predictive performance. The findings will contribute to a better understanding of the factors that determine mushroom edibility and provide a reliable tool for identifying potentially toxic mushrooms. The project's outcomes can be used in various fields, including culinary arts, foragers, and mushroom enthusiasts, to ensure the safe consumption of mushrooms.

Limitations and Future Work:
It's important to acknowledge that the project's results depend on the provided dataset and the selected machine learning algorithms. The accuracy of the predictions might vary when applied to real-world scenarios, considering the vast diversity of mushroom species and potential variations in features not captured in the dataset. Future work may involve collecting a more comprehensive dataset with additional features and exploring advanced machine learning techniques to improve the prediction accuracy.
